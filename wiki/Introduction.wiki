#summary Introduction to REST Notes

= Introduction =

REST Notes is a sample notes app. Notes are stored on a server, and exposed trough an WebObjects application using the ERRest framework. The iPhone application uses the exposed REST API to create users, login, create, read, edit and delete notes.

Please take into consideration this is NOT supposed to be a final product. The interface is ugly, there may be a few bugs, and some stuff isn't as optimized as it can be. I wrote this simply to get the feeling of how to correctly write REST stuff, and make it available for the community.
