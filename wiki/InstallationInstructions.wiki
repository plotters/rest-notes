  # Import the project into Eclipse.
  # Open !NotesModel (in Resources) and adjust the Default DB connection to your database. You need to create an empty database too, of course.
  # Run the app and stop it to create a run configuration. To do that, right-click on the Application class and choose Run as > WOApplication.
  # Edit the run configuration and set a fixed WOPort for the application. This is convenient for having a fixed URL the iPhone can connect to.

Here, you just need to open the XCode project and edit the Info.plist file. Locate the NotesURL entry, and adjust the URL to your installation. Note that you may use https (assuming you configured apache correctly) even if your local SSL certificate is invalid.

That's it, you should now be able to run both apps and use REST Notes.
